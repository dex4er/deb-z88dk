<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Z88 Development Kit - Downloads</H1>

<H2>CVS Access</H2>

<P>You can browse the <A HREF="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/?cvsroot=z88dk">cvs</A> repository if you like (I've just set it up so it's
not that exciting!!)

<H2>Archives</H2>

<P> Archive 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/filelist.php?group_id=2917">downloads</A> 
are also available and probably make more sense.

<H1><A NAME="patches">Patches</A></H1>

<P>Sometimes I make a mistake with an archive and forget to include certain
files or occasionally update certain files. The files below can be applied
over the top of the z88dk directory to rectify these sort of situations. The filename
(before the '_' is the version to which the patch should be applied.</P>

<UL>
	<LI> No patches for v1.3 (yet!) - But check cvs! stdlib.h and Makefile
	have changed slightly
</UL>

<P>These patch files may also be found on the <A HREF="ftp://z88dk.sourceforge.net/pub/z88dk/">ftp server</A></P>

<P>There are a couple of modifications that need to be made to v1.31- the makefile creates the softlink to the default config file incorrectly - remove the lib/config
before the zcc.cfg in {z88dk}/Makefile. The file {z88dk}/include/stdlib.h
needs a semi-colon inserting after the prototype for csleep otherwise
strange things will happen.</P>

<H2>Installing</H2>

<P>Once you've downloaded the archive, this simple guide should get you up and running:</P>

<OL>
	<LI> Check {z88dk}/src/z80asm/config.h for machine status and endian status.
ENDIAN is set if the machine is big endian (68k,PPC,Sparc etc)
	<LI> Type: make
	<LI> Wait
	<LI> Add {z88dk}/bin into your path
	<LI> Define the environmental variable Z80_OZFILES to point to the directory {z88dk}lib/

	<LI> Define the environmental variable ZCCCFG to point to the 
	directory {z88dk}lib/config/

</OL>
<P>Where {z88dk} is the root directory of the archive. With that you should
be sorted and ready to go.</P>

<P>z88dk is known to work on the following systems: Amiga, Be, Linux,
Solaris, HP-UX, Win32, Win16, MSDOS</P>
	

<P>MSDOS/win32 binaries are available from
