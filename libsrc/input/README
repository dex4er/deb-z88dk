These functions are machine-dependent and are therefore
compiled into each target machine's standard library.  The
lst files here list all functions for each machine but
the contents of these files are copied into the machine-specific
lst files found in the libsrc directory.

Eg:  spectrum.lst lists the functions implemented for the
ZX spectrum target.  Its contents are copied into zx.lst
and zxansi.lst in the libsrc directory.
