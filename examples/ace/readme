These samples have been tested with the VACE emulator.
After compiling they can be converted with bin2byt utility, then loaded on the emulator.
The FORTH commands are
16384 30000 bload smallgfx      --> (or other file name)
16384 call

I suppose the RAMTOP (or whatever name is used on the ACE for the Stack Pointer) should 
be set in a safe location, but I have on idea on how to do this (or on where is it by default).

The ADV_A.C source code is already present under the ZX Spectrum samples.
