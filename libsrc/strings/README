All routines in this directory are machine independent!

Some of these routines shouldn't (won't be!) recompiled - these
are hand optimized

strtok contains a static variable!!! This routine CANNOT be ROM'd!!

These routines should be machine imdependent - i.e. they could be
shoved into z80_crt0 but that might muddy the waters somewhat!!

<manic grin> I've gone thru several of these and the C code 
generated is smaller than my brief hand optimizations!!! Wicked!

I've rewritten str(r)chr in asm so they're even shorter 'n' faster
strncmp has been rewritten cos it didn't work for me..though it did
for gwl..who knows eh?
