      <td valign="Top">z88dk runs on a wide variety of platforms. Most of
the development has been done under emulation, indeed only the z88 and TI
platforms are tested on `real' machines. On this page you'll find a variety
of screenshots of different programs on different platforms.<br>

DStar is a tricky puzzle game that was originally written in z80 for the
TI86. I found it on <a href="http://www.ticalc.org">ticalc.org</a> and ported
it over to C. It's since been ported over to many of the z88dk targets.<br>
      <br>
The z88 version is a fully fledged z88 application, cooperating perfectly
with the z88 operating system OZ.<br>

Here's DStar running on the ZX Spectrum. All that was needed to port this
from the z88 was a short routine to write the game map to the screen.<br>

I promise that this is the last DStar picture! Here it is running on the
Jupiter Ace. The blockiness is due to the fact that the Ace only has low
resolution graphics (64x48).<br>

This has to be one of my favourite screenshots. Stefano left the emulator
running for quite a while to capture this greyscale picture of part of the
mandelbrot set.<br>

The Sharp MZ running the VT100 test program. This program tests all features
of the VT100 emulation. The asterix instead of an 'F' is I believe the hardware

Adventure 'A' was one of the first adventure games available for the ZX81
and Spectrum. Paul Taylor converted it to C and made it run on multiple platforms
(see the <a href="http://www.penelope.demon.co.uk/pod/">Planet Of Death</a>
 page on his site). Naturally it had to be ported over to z88dk. Very few<br>
changes needed to be made, and here it is, running on the ZX81 once more!<br>
