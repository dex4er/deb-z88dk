      <td nosave="">&nbsp;<b><i>z88dk</i></b> is a z80 C cross compiler
supplied    with an assembler/linker and a set of libraries
implementing the C standard    library for a number of different z80
based machines. The name z88dk originates    from the time when the
project was founded and supported only the Cambridge    z88 portable.  
      <p>The compiler featured in z88dk is much enhanced Small C
compiler,   the compiler accepts many features of ANSI C and is only
deficient in a few  areas where implementation on a z80 processor might
prove inefficient. The  compiler performs simple optimizations, but the
bulk of the optimization   is done by a set of peep-hole rules, which
will typically reduce the size   of a large project by up to a third. </p>
      <p>The libraries supplied with z88dk are designed to be as
generic as possible, indeed it is possible to port to a new machine
simply by supplying   two library routines and some startup code. It is
hoped that one day z88dk    will support as many z80 based machines as
there is information available    and sufficient interest in. <br>

 <ul>
        <li> Small C+ based compiler with structs, floats and other ANSI
extensions</li>
        <li> Module assembler/linker which only includes required
library routines</li>
        <li> Peephole optimizer with rulesets that reduce the size of
generated   code by ~30% and improve speed</li>
        <li> Easily retargetted C library including stdio routines</li>
        <li> Retargettable VT100 terminal</li>
        <li> Support for over a 25 z80 based machines (see below for
details)</li>

will run  on the following machines: Cambridge Computers z88, Sinclair
ZX Spectrum,   Sinclair ZX81, CP/M based machines, Amstrad NC100,
VZ200/300, Sharp MZ series,   TI calculators (TI82, TI83, TI83+, TI85,
TI86), ABC80, Jupiter Ace, Xircom REX 6000, Peters Sprinter, Sam Coupe,
MSX1,Spectravideo,   Mattel Aquarius, Peters Sprinter, and C128 (in z80
mode) machines. The level of <a href="platforms.html"> support</a>

      <td><b><i>&nbsp;z88dk </i></b>is known to run on the following
platforms:    Amiga, BeOS, HP-UX 9, Linux, MacOS X, Solaris, Win32,
Win16 and MSDOS. Binary releases are available for Amiga, Solaris and
Win32. Win16/MSDOS needs be rolled by the user. On BSD machines, GNU
make should be used instead of the native make program.<br>

      <td>&nbsp;Dom Morris started the project in August 1998
targetting the  z88, and adding preliminary Spectrum support, and
functional Amstrad NC100  support. Stefano Bodrato is responsible for
the other ports. Henk Poley is refining and improving, with Stefano,
the TI  calculator support. Dennis Gr&ouml;ning is, as ever, coaxing
z88dk to run as well on Windows as it does on Unix.                    
      <p>So, if you have a problem with library support (except for the
z88)    contact either Stefano or Henk, or a problem with anything
else, or if you  want to retarget to a new machine contact <a

A couple of issues have arisen from the 1.5 release. This small <a
 href="z88dk-1.50-patch1.zip">patch</a> will resolve these issues. To
install, download the zip file cd to the z88dk directory and unzip.
This patch should work on all platforms.<b><span

downloads</a><b><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> </b>page to
get the latest. This release has support for 25 different Z80 based <a

We're still alive! Many things have been added in CVS such as ZXVGS
support. Bugs have been fixed and we now have a copt that supports
regular expressions. Soon full stdio support for the Rex6000 will be
integrated. And yes, we will try to make a release soon now that the
Win32 problems have been resolved.<br>
