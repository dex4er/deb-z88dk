Description: a Z80 processor assembler and SmallC+ cross compiler
 z88dk is a SmallC+ and Z80 assemler cross compiler supplied with an
 assembler/linker and a set of libraries implementing the C standard library
 for a number of different z80 based machines. The name z88dk originates from
 the time when the project was founded and supported only the Cambridge
 z88 portable.
 .
 Supported machines:
 Cambridge Computers z88, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Sinclair ZX81, CP/M based
 machines, Amstrad NC100, VZ200/300, Sharp MZ series, TI calculators (TI82,
 TI83, TI83+, TI85, TI86), ABC80, Jupiter Ace, Xircom REX 6000, Peters
 Sprinter, Sam Coupe, MSX1, Spectravideo, Mattel Aquarius, Peters Sprinter,
 and C128 (in z80 mode) machines.
 .
 Features:
  * Small C+ based compiler with structs, floats and other ANSI extensions
  * Module assembler/linker which only includes required library routines
  * Peephole optimizer with rulesets that reduce the size of generated code
    by ~30% and improve speed
  * Easily retargetted C library including stdio routines
  * Retargettable VT100 terminal
  * Support for over a 25 z80 based machines (see below for details)
