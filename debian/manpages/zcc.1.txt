NAME
  zcc - The frontend of z88dk
SYSNOPIS
  zcc [flags] [files to be compiled/linked]
DESCRIPTION
  This manual page documents briefly the z88dk tools. This manual page
  was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution (but may be used
  by others), because the original program does not have a manual page.


  Please refer to the z88dk documentation in /usr/share/doc/z88dk-doc/ for the complete description of the system.
  If /usr/share/doc/z88dk-doc not exists, please install the package z88dk-doc.

  The frontend of z88dk is called zcc, it is this that you should call
  if you want to do any compilations.

  The files can be either C files (.c), preprocessed C files(.i),
  compiled C files (.asm), optimised compiled file (.opt) or assembled
  files (.obj), any combination of them can be mixed together and the
  relevant processed done on them.

  Processing of a file list is done on each file in turn (i.e. preprocess,
  compile, optimise, assemble) at the end all files may be linked into
  a single executable if desired.

OPTIONS

  -a            Produce .asm (or .opt) file only
  -c            Do not link object files
  -E            Preprocess files only, leave output in .i file
  -o [file]     Specify output file for binary (default is a.bas for BASIC programs and a.bin for application binaries)
  -On           Optimize compiler output (to .opt file) n can be either 0 (none) 1,2,3, level 2 is recommended. Level 3 is suitable for large programs (includes certain lib functions to reduce size of code(!))
  -v            Verbose - echo commands as they are executed
  -vn           Don't be verbose



  Options to control library usage:
  -l[name]      Link in a library - supply just the name (after placing them in the correct directory).

      The 'name' are:
      farz88       Z88 far support
      gfx          Z88 BASIC graphics lib
      gfxapp       Z88 application graphics lib
      m            Generic math routines
      malloc       Generic near malloc routine
      mz           OZ's math routines
      ndos         Fake file-routines, return errors only
      net          Z88 socket routines for ZSock
      netdev       Z88 socket routines for devices
      p3           +3 file support library
      tigray82     Ti82 graylib routines
      tigray83     Ti83 graylib routines
      tigray83p    Ti83+ graylib routines
      tigray85     Ti85 graylib routines
      tigray86     Ti86 graylib routines
      z88          Some Z88 application routines, like mailboxing
      zxmath       ZX Spectrum ROM based math routines
      zxvgs        ZXVGS hardware support
  
  -m            Generate .map files when assembling/linking



  Options to control the type code produced:
  -unsigned     Implicitly define everything as unsigned unless explicitly told otherwise.
  -create-app   Create an application image (i.e. bank 63,62 etc)
  -make-app     (App) Notify the compiler that you're trying to make an application
  -reqpag=      (App) Number of 256 byte pages required for bad application
  -zorg=        (App) Origin for a Z88 application
  -safedata=    (App) Amount of safedata required by your code
  -defvars=     (App) Where static variables should be dropped (only valid for single file compilations, but see later)
  -expandz88    (App) Expanded z88 required
  -no-expandz88 (App) Expanded z88 not required (these two flags toggle some startup code to check for an expanded machine)
  -startup=3    Produce standalone code that can be run from a set address from BASIC. Use -zorg= to change the address
  -R            (Use with above) produces relocatable code that can be loaded into a DIM'd BASIC array.
  -smartpf      Intelligent printf routine handling
  -no-smartpf   Turn off the intelligent printf handling
  -make-lib     Shortcut to generate .o files from library .c files
  -stackoffset  Sets the stack offset for shared libs (see package.txt for details)
                   


  Miscellaneous options:
  -z80-verb     Allow z80asm to be verbose, this tends to generate a lot
                   of output to the screen so may not be desired.
  -cc           Intersperse C code as comments in the assembler output, warning:
                   this *will* clobber some optimizations.
  -Wall         Turn on all the compiler warnings
  -Wnone        Turn off all compiler warnings
  -Wn[num]      Turn off the compiler warning [num]
  -W[num]       Turn on the compiler warning [num]
  -asxx	        Cause the compiler to emit asxx compatible code
  -Cp[option]   Pass an option through to the pre-processor
  -Ca[option]   Pass an option through to the assembler

  In addition, the flags, -D, -I, -U are passed through to the preprocessor.
