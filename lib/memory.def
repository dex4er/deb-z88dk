; Standard Z88	Operating	System manifests:

; The information below is defined	in Developers Notes, release 3.00
; (c) Cambridge Computer	1989-95

; Memory allocation, deallocation:

	DEFC	Os_Mop = $4E			; Open memory (allocate memory pool)
	DEFC	Os_Mal = $54			; Allocate memory
	DEFC	Os_Axp = $D206			; Allocate explicit	page	(internal	OZ usage)
	DEFC	Os_Mfr = $57			; Free memory
	DEFC	Os_Mcl = $51			; Close memory	(free memory pool)

; Memory information movement:

	DEFC	Os_Bde = $DA06			; Copy bytes to extended	address
	DEFC	Os_Bhl = $DC06			; Copy bytes from extended address
	DEFC	Gn_Rbe = $3E09			; Read byte at	extended address
	DEFC	Gn_Wbe = $4009			; Write byte to extended	address

; Memory comparison:

    DEFC Gn_Cme  = $4209			; compare	null-terminated strings

; Memory/bank binding:

	DEFC	Os_Mgb = $5A			; Get current binding
	DEFC	Os_Mpb = $5D			; Set (Put) new binding
	DEFC	Os_Bix = $60			; Bind in	extended address (internal)
	DEFC	Os_Box = $63			; Restore	bindings after	OS_BIX (internal)

; Fast code interface for bank switching (A=1)

	DEFC	Os_Fc  = $8A

; Linked list manipulation calls (often	used	in combination	with	Os_Mal):

	DEFC	Gn_Xin = $4609
	DEFC	Gn_Xnx = $4409
	DEFC	Gn_Xdl = $4809

; Memory Masks	used	by Os_Mop:

	DEFC	MM_S0 = $00			; Segment	0 mask
	DEFC	MM_S1 = $40			; Segment	1 mask
	DEFC	MM_S2 = $80			; Segment	2 mask
	DEFC	MM_S3 = $C0			; Segment	3 mask

; additional allocation directives	for Os_Mop:
	; Source of memory (to be allocated):
	DEFC	MM_FIX = $02			; fixed workspace (not subject to swapping)

	DEFC	MM_SLT = $04			; explicit slot usage, masked	with:
		DEFC	MC_CI = $10		; internal memory
		DEFC	MC_C1 = $01		; card 1
		DEFC	MC_C2 = $02		; card 2
		DEFC	MC_C3 = $03		; card 3

	; Allocation variations:
	DEFC	MM_EXC = $10			; exclusive use of bank
	DEFC	MM_MUL = $20			; use multiple	banks


; Segment	specifiers used by Os_Mgb, Os_Mpb:

	DEFC	MS_S0 = $00			; Segment	0 specifier
	DEFC	MS_S1 = $01			; Segment	1 specifier
	DEFC	MS_S2 = $02			; Segment	2 specifier
	DEFC	MS_S3 = $03			; Segment	3 specifier

; Low level OZ	memory organisation	definitions:
; (these manifests represents	bit identifiers in a configuration	byte	that
; is	(returned	by OS_NQ,	NQ_SLT):

	DEFC	BU_EPR = 1			; bank is	EPROM
	DEFC	BU_ROM = 2			; bank is	ROM
	DEFC	BU_WRK = 4			; work memory
	DEFC	BU_FIX = 8			; fixed memory
	DEFC	BU_RES = 16			; reserved memory
	DEFC	BU_APL = 32			; bank is	application RAM
	DEFC	BU_FRE = 128			; bank is	available	RAM
